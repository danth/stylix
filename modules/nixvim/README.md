# Nixvim

This Stylix module leverages the modules provided by
[Nixvim](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim). Ensure that the desired
Nixvim module is properly
[installed](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)
and
[imported](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim?tab=readme-ov-file#usage)
into your user configuration. When configuring `stylix.targets.nixvim` options,
ensure that you are configuring them in the same scope (NixOS, Home Manager,
Darwin) as you imported the Nixvim module.
